#The Chrd Chord Chart Editor
[www.chrd.co.uk](www.chrd.co.uk)

Chrd is a markup language and text editor for typesetting chord charts.

##BUILDING
Building requires libharu (an up to date version, probably built from source to
enable UTF8), libz, libpng, gtk3, gtksourceview, evince, clang, make and xxd.
With these dependencies installed, Chrd may then be built simply by running
`make`. It can then by installed with `sudo make install` and, if needed,
uninstalled with `sudo make uninstall`.

##COPYING
Chrd is free software under the GNU GPLv3. For full details, see "COPYING".
